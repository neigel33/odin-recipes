As part of my journey through the Odin Project course, I will develop 
a simple HTML webpage. This project aims to strengthen my understanding
of HTML coding conventions, proper page structure, and best practices.
Additionally, I will learn how to link the project to my GitHub
repository for version control and portfolio showcasing.
